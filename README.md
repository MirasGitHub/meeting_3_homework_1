# meeting_3_homework_1

Do the similar task of Meeting-2 Homework using Classes.
Add a class called Vehicle that will be extended by the Car class.
The constructor of the Vehicle class must receive two arguments, make and model, therefore these variables must be described in this class and not in the Car class, therefore the Car class will inherit it from the Vehicle.
